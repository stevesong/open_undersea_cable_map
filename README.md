Open Undersea Cable Map
========================

This is a fork of [TeleGeography's](https://www.telegeography.com) submarine cable map from when it was last licensed under a Creative Commons license in late 2022. The map depicts active and planned submarine cable systems, their landing stations, cable length, ready for service (RFS) date, owners, suppliers, and website. Telegeography's up-to-date but now commercial map can be found at [https://www.submarinecablemap.com](https://www.submarinecablemap.com). This repository contains only the data files in json format from the original.
