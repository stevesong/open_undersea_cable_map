Open Undersea Cable Map
========================

This is a fork of [TeleGeography's](https://www.telegeography.com) submarine cable map from when it was last licensed under a Creative Commons license in late 2022. The map depicts active and planned submarine cable systems, their landing stations, cable length, ready for service (RFS) date, owners, suppliers, and website. Telegeography's up-to-date but now commercial map can be found at [https://www.submarinecablemap.com](https://www.submarinecablemap.com).


Installation
------------

Install a LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management, and finally [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/).

    $ git clone git://github.com/telegeography/www.submarinecablemap.com.git
    $ cd www.submarinecablemap.com
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn redwood dev

How did you make the Submarine Cable Map?
-------------------------------

[TeleGeography](http://www.telegeography.com) draws the cable routes and plots the landing points with [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). Using [Avenza's MAPublisher](https://www.avenza.com/mapublisher) plug-in, which works with Illustrator, two sets of data are exported as GeoJSON: the cable routes (as MultiLineStrings) and landing points (as Points).

This interactive map Javascript was created using the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) web application framework.  The Javascript for the map was written in-house at TeleGeography.
